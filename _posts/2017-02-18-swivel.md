<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>For the final assignment in the Interaction Design Studio class at Carnegie Mellon University, I worked on a team to conceptualize an application for an existing Internet of Things device and create a two-minute film demonstrating how it would hypothetically work.</p>
<p>Our concept is Swivel, a connected office chair that uses weight sensors in the seat and back. With these sensors, the chair can determine when it is occupied, who is occupying it, and can provide real-time feedback regarding the occupantâ€™s posture.</p>
<p>Swivel fulfills several needs in commercial office spaces, where poor ergonomics harmfully impacts employee health and productivity. Additionally, it provides a rich set of data which employers can use to make their office space more intelligent and adaptive.</p>
<p>Below we detail the process through which we developed this idea and how we chose to depict it.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>This is a project I worked on for my Interaction Design Studio class at Carnegie Mellon University. My team was responsible for designing a mobile application to provide a service to a particular audience. Chose between four different problems, each of which defined a primary and secondary persona. After selecting our problem based off of group interest, we rapidly conducted guerrilla research to gain additional insights into the problem space, and iterated on a mobile application design. Our final deliverables were a click-through InVision prototype, a presentation explaining our insights into the problem space as well as how our application addresses them, and a profesionally prepared document detailing our process.</p>

<h3>Our Problem</h3>
<p>Parking is expensive and difficult to find, yet some research suggests that around 3 parking spaces exist for every car.</p>
<p>How can a resource seem scarce, yet actually be so abundant?</p>
<p>One contributing factor is that some spaces can only be utilized by a specific person, like a driveway at someone’s house. When the homeowner is away, their driveway is unoccupied, making it an un-utilized resource. Is it possible to make these exclusive resources available to others when their primary owner is not using them? And why doesn’t this happen now? One contributing factor is that there is a mutual lack of trust between the person with the driveway and the person looking for parking.</p>

<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<p>MeterMaid is an application that enables homeowners to capitalize upon their open driveway space by connecting with drivers seeking convenient and affordable parking. We designed it specifically to facilitate trust between the two parties, particularly on the homeowner’s side by enabling them to monitor their property in the application, report inappropriate or malicious behavior, and filter out and block certain users.</p>

<h3>Personas</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the project, we received four different problems, each with a primary and secondary persona. We chose to focus on parking because it seemed the most interesting. We received two personas: one for the person who wants to make money off of their unoccupied driveway and another who is looking for more affordable parking.</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>After examining the personas and problem statement, we conducted an Ecosystem Collection where we discussed what we know about the parking domain, discussed what we don’t know, and defined the critical questions to explore.</p>
<img class="portfolio-img" src="../img/MeterMaid/ecosystem-collection.png">
<p>From the ecosystem collection, we determined that we should focus on understanding what the current experience is for people looking for parking as well as understanding the factors that go into successful crowd-sharing platforms such as Uber, AirBnB, and eBay, particularly how they build trust between their users.</p>
<p>Based on this focus, we generated the following specific research objectives:</p>
<ol>
    <li>To gain a more complete understanding of the context in which people look for parking and what they prioritize (proximity, cost, etc.).</li>
    <li>To understand the existing choices for parking and how they operate.</li>
    <li>To understand the trust mechanics of existing resource sharing services (e.g. AirBnB, Uber) and to understand what led current users to trust these services.</li>
</ol>
<p>To address the first two research objectives, we developed a short survey on Google Forms and distributed it on social media. Respondents answered questions such as how frequently they use public parking, what is important to them when finding parking, and how long it took them to find a spot to park in the last time they used public parking.</p>
<p>To address the second research objective, we explored the various parking options in Pittsburgh and reached out to several landlords who handle parking asking for an interview. Of the individuals we reached out to, only one responded. We visited that one person and conducted a brief one-hour interview.</p>
<p>Regarding the third research objective of how other resource-sharing services built trust between users, we conducted a literature review, as well as interviewed Uber drivers to better understand what incentivized them to get started and how Uber protects them and their assets.</p>

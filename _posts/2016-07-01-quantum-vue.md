The one that started it all. I inherited the Quantum Vue project from other researchers and designers so most of the work was already done by the time I arrived. I started by adding new features and gradually became the expert on the software.

Most of the work I did resolved around wireframes and usability testing. Additionally, I coordinated with the development team to ensure that the shipping product met the desired specifications. I also oversaw the install of the system into several customer buildings around the world, including places such as the Wells Fargo building in Charlotte, NC and Supercell in San Francisco, CA.
